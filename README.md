This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand patterns and relationships in the data. The dataset includes passenger details like age, sex, class, and survival status.

Key steps include data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature analysis. Visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn highlight survival trends based on features like gender, passenger class, and age groups.

Insights gained guide further analysis and model building for predictive tasks.

Run eda.py to generate visualizations and summary statistics. The project is beginner-friendly and open to contributions under the MIT license.
